               ===========================================
               Brief User's Guide for SCIM (version 1.4.4)
               ===========================================

SCIM is an older and mature input method platform, and supports many different
input methods (IMs) to make input of complicated characters in X environment
possible.

There are SCIM plugin modules for many languages such as Japanese, Chinese,
Korean, Arabic, and many Indic languages.

Most description for the new IBus at
http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch08.en.html#_the_keyboard_input
is applicable to this older SCIM.

(Older documents in Japanese and English are available at:
 http://wiki.debian.org/JapaneseEnvironmentE (English)
 http://wiki.debian.org/JapaneseEnvironment  (Japanese)
 http://wiki.debian.org/UTF8vimE (English)
 http://wiki.debian.org/UTF8vim  (Japanese)
These are focused to use im-switch and UTF-8 locales under etch.  Use of
im-config should provide easier configuration but im-switch can still be used
under squeeze.)

---------------
Debian Packages
---------------

The package scim is the core package of SCIM platform.  To really use SCIM you
also need one module package to provide input methods for the language you
use.  The modules packaged in Debian currently are (categorized by language):

scim-anthy, scim-uim, scim-skk, scim-prime, scim-canna, scim-tables-ja
                                                                (for Japanese)
scim-pinyin, scim-tables-zh
                                                      (for simplified Chinese)
scim-chewing, scim-tables-zh
                                                     (for traditional Chinese)
scim-hangul, scim-tables-ko, scim-uim
                                                                  (for Korean)
scim-m17n, scim-tables-additional, scim-uim
                                                         (for other languages)

You need to read the documentation of the particular module package to see if
your language or favorite input method is supported.

The packages scim-gtk-immodule-orig and scim-gtk-immodule provide GTK IM
mode for SCIM.  For more details, please read README.GTK.

In summary, you should install package scim and one of the IM module package
to start.  You may install scim-gtk-immodule-orig or scim-gtk-immodule if
you use GTK+ applications and want to try the GTK IM mode. You shouldn't need
to explicitly install any other package as they should be installed as
necessary due to dependency.

-------
Locales
-------

SCIM should work in all UTF-8 locales.  It can also work in some Chinese (zh),
Japanese (ja), and Korean (ko) non UTF-8 locales, but it usually requires some
additional configuration.  The maintainer of scim package recommends using
UTF-8 locale. :-)

There is one limitation in SCIM, that you must tell SCIM the UTF-8 locale you
want to use SCIM in.  This is recorded in the user's configuration file
~/.scim/global.  You need to add a line of the format
    /SupportedUnicodeLocales = <your_locale>
to your ~/.scim/global file unless you use en_US.UTF-8 locale (which is
supported by default).  The <your_locale> string should be in ll_CC.UTF-8
form, where ll being the language, and CC being the country.  You can always
use the "locale" command to check your locale setting.  You can also add
multiple locales there, just separate them by comma without space, like
    /SupportedUnicodeLocales = en_US.UTF-8,en_GB.UTF_8,fr_FR.UTF-8

If you have never used SCIM before, your ~/.scim/global may be not existent.
You can run ``scim'' from an X terminal, then press Ctrl-C to abort it, this
configure file should be created for the user.

If there are many users on a system and use the same locale, you may want to
consider change the system configuration file /etc/scim/global to set the
supported locale.

----------
Using SCIM
----------

After setting up locale, you can try using SCIM to input in your language.
SCIM can be used in two modes: XIM mode and GTK IM mode.

To use XIM (X Input Method) mode, you need to set the environment variable
XMODIFIERS and GTK_IM_MODULE before starting your X application (you
only need to set GTK_IM_MODULE/QT_IM_MODULE if the X application you want
to run also uses GTK+).  Run the following commands in an X terminal
(such as xterm, gnome-terminal or konsole):
    $ XMODIFIERS="@im=SCIM"
    $ export XMODIFIERS
    $ GTK_IM_MODULE="xim"
    $ QT_IM_MODULE="xim"
    $ export GTK_IM_MODULE
    $ export QT_IM_MODULE
    $ scim -d
Now you should see some output by SCIM saying it's successfully launched, and
if your have a system tray, there should be an icon of keyboard image
appearing there (the image of the icon will change according to the input
method status).  Then you can start an X program in the same terminal, for
example
    $ gedit
will start the gedit text editor.  Press Ctrl-space should activate SCIM
and you can start using your input method (remember you need to install
the module package for your input method).  Note you must start the program
you want to use input method in from the same X terminal.  To enable using
SCIM in programs launched in any way, see the "Autostart SCIM" section below.

GTK+ has its own input method framework, so GTK+/GNOME programs can use
SCIM in an additional mode, GTK IM mode.  Note again that GTK+/GNOME
programs can use XIM mode, too, so the scim-gtk-immodule-orig or
scim-gtk-immodule and GTK IM mode are not essential for using input
methods in GTK+ applications.  SCIM's GTK IM mode is provided as a GTK
IM module by the scim-gtk-immodule-orig or scim-gtk-immodule package, and
SCIM can automatically start if you choose this module.  So using GTK IM
mode is simpler, just start a GTK+/GNOME program, right-click and choose
"Input Methods -> SCIM Input Method" in the pop-up menu, and SCIM should
automatically start if it's not started yet.  Now pressing Ctrl-space
should also activate SCIM and you can start typing.  An alternative way
to start GTK+ applications using SCIM at the GTK IM module is by using
GTK_IM_MODULE environment variable, such as:
    $ GTK_IM_MODULE="scim-orig"
    $ export GTK_IM_MODULE
    $ gedit
for scim-gtk-immodule-orig, or
    $ GTK_IM_MODULE="scim"
    $ export GTK_IM_MODULE
    $ gedit
for scim-gtk-immodule.
This way SCIM will automatically start when you start the GTK+ program,
and automatically stop when you quit the program.  This may cause delay
for program start/quit though, so it's always a good idea to explicitly
start SCIM by "scim -d" command.

--------------
Autostart SCIM
--------------

It's quite inconvenient to set environment variables and manually start SCIM
each time you log in, so you want to start SCIM automatically when your X
session starts.  This is not hard, you just need to put the commands of
setting variables and start SCIM into a configuration file X reads when it
starts.  For example, the following lines in ~/.gnomerc should work if you
want to start SCIM automatically with GNOME:
    LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    export LANG
    XMODIFIERS="@im=SCIM"
    export XMODIFIERS
    GTK_IM_MODULE="xim"
    QT_IM_MODULE="xim"
    export GTK_IM_MODULE
    export QT_IM_MODULE
    scim -d
Change the en_US.UTF-8 to your preferred locale, and change GTK_IM_MODULE to
"scim" if you want to use GTK IM mode instead of XIM mode.

The hard part is to figure out which configuration file to put these in.  One
choice is to put it in ~/.xsession, and add your X session command at the end
of the file (such as "exec gnome-session" or "exec startkde").  But this way
you always need to modify this file to change X session, and the feature of
choosing session in GDM/KDM will not work anymore.

There are other packages to help these configuration easier, see the next
section.

---------------
Helper Packages im-config (newer)
---------------

The im-config package will help user to set up their input methods.

The im-config package provides the framework for input method packages to
provide their own customization scripts.  It uses hook script in
/etc/X11/Xsession.d/ to read these customization scripts and set environment
for input methods.  But this package's configuration is choosing among SCIM,
UIM, ... etc only.  The detail choices within SCIM modules are done by
installing relevant packages and configuring through SCIM GUI configuration
tool. (This is the same situation between UIM modules.)

If you start X in one of CJK environment while scim and im-config are
installed, it should start SCIM automatically unless you have higher priority
package (such as IBus) for IM.

If you just want to set one user account to use SCIM, just type:
  $ im-config
(The menu lists only available IMs.)

If you do the same from root use, you set system wide default.
  # im-config
(The menu lists only available IMs.)

UTF-8 locales such as ja_JP.UTF-8 enables to edit any text of any
languages, i.e., multilingualization (m17n) environment. Thus UTF-8
locale are recommended to be used with SCIM.  In order to edit files
encoded in other locales such as ja_JP.eucJP, pl_PL.ISO-8859-2, ...,
you need to set up editor to handle them too.  Please refer to

The im-config package does not change ~/.scim/global or /etc/scim/global
to enable all available UTF-8 locales for SCIM since you may want to start
some locales without SCIM.  You still need to manually enable your locale
(see the "Locales" section above).

Select UTF-8 locale using GDM/KDM menu.

You can also manually edit/create startup script from
  /etc/X11/xinit/xinputrc and ~/.xinputrc

Good templates for the contents of these files can be found in
/usr/share/im-config/data/*.im .

---------------
Helper Packages im-switch (older)
---------------

The im-switch package will help user to set up their input methods.

The im-switch package provides the framework for input method packages to
provide their own customization scripts.  It uses hook script in
/etc/X11/Xsession.d/ to read these customization scripts and set environment
for input methods.  But this package's configuration is choosing among SCIM,
UIM, ... etc only.  The detail choices within SCIM modules are done by
installing relevant packages and configuring through SCIM GUI configuration
tool. (This is the same situation between UIM modules.)

If you start X in one of CJK environment while scim and im-switch are
installed, it should start SCIM automatically unless you have higher priority
package for IM.

To see what is your IM,
  $ im-switch -l
will list complete situation.  If you just want to set one user account
to use SCIM, just type:
  $ im-switch -s scim-immodule
The same can be done with menu selection as:
  $ im-switch -c

If you do the same from root use, you set system wide default.
  # im-switch -s scim-immodule
  # im-switch -c

The activation of SCIM is default only for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK)
environment.  Above command set up SCIM only for one locale.  If you wish to
enable SCIM system wide for all locales, configure SCIM from root as:
  # im-switch -z zh_CN -s scim-immodule
  # im-switch -z zh_TW -s scim-immodule
  # im-switch -z zh_HK -s scim-immodule
  # im-switch -z zh_SG -s scim-immodule
  # im-switch -z ja_JP -s scim-immodule
  # im-switch -z ko_KR -s scim-immodule
  # im-switch -z all_ALL -s scim-immodule

Then you clear the user specific configurations with
  $ im-switch -a

UTF-8 locales such as ja_JP.UTF-8 enables to edit any text of any
languages, i.e., multilingualization (m17n) environment. Thus UTF-8
locale are recommended to be used with SCIM.  In order to edit files
encoded in other locales such as ja_JP.eucJP, pl_PL.ISO-8859-2, ...,
you need to set up editor to handle them too.  Please refer to

The im-switch package does not change ~/.scim/global or /etc/scim/global
to enable all available UTF-8 locales for SCIM since you may want to start
some locales without SCIM.  You still need to manually enable your locale
(see the "Locales" section above).

Select UTF-8 locale using GDM/KDM menu.

(You can also add customization scripts in /etc/X11/Xsession.d/ directly,
of course, but the maintainer would discourage this.)

-------------------
Further information
-------------------

Debian users should read the other README files in /usr/share/doc/scim/ for
using SCIM in different desktop environments.  There is also an scim(1) man
page worth reading.

The Debian packaging work of SCIM related packages is coordinated on a mailing
list on Alioth, pkg-ime-devel@list.alioth.debian.org.  You can subscribe to it
or read the web archives for some useful information.  See
    http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/pkg-ime-devel
about this mailing list.

The SCIM upstream website is at http://www.scim-im.org/ but the Debian
specific information is probably quite sparse.

-----------
Report Bugs
-----------

SCIM is still not perfect, and there are always some corner case usability
issues.  So please report bugs (install the reportbug package and use the
reportbug program, it's not hard to report a bug)!  SCIM involves many
languages and input methods, only with every user's testing and help can we
keep improving it and provide better input method support in Debian.  Thanks!
