      (Closes: #417686, again)

      avoid waking up CPU constantly, therefore preserve power consumption and
      extend laptop battery life.  (Fixes LP: #122445)
    - Change 10_gtk-immodule-install-dir dpatch to patch configure.ac instead
      of extras/gtk2_immodule/Makefile.am, to adapt to the upstream change.
    - Regenerate 90_relibtoolize dpatch.  Also adjust the timestamp touching
      in debian/rules accordingly.
  * Clarify build dependency.
    - Remove intltool as upstream tarball ships its own 0.33 version.
    - Add libpango1.0-dev, libglib2.0-dev, and pkg-config explicitly (used to
      be pulled in by libgtk2.0-dev).

    pulled in by libgtk2.0-dev.
  * Add scim-thai to scim's "Suggests:" list.
  * Add "-W -g" compiler flags back.  The warnings are somehow useful when
    reading the build logs, and the debug information will be useful for
    manually built packages with DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nostrip.
  * Change maintainer's email address.

    - The "Exit" item in the menu of notification area icon is built by

    - Add debian/libscim-dev.NEWS file to alert the changes of module
      installation path (will be installed as the NEWS.Debian file for
      libscim-dev package).  Also rename debian/NEWS file to debian/scim.NEWS.
