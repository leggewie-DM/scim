Description: smart common input method platform
 Smart Common Input Method (SCIM) is an input method (IM) platform.  Input
 methods are needed to enter complex characters in many non-latin languages.
 SCIM provides a common platform for various plugin modules and independent IM
 programs, as well as a set of modules and programs on its own.  It is highly
 modularized and exposes abstract interfaces, so that plugin modules with
 different functions can easily communicate with each other.  The currently
 supported module types are configuration, IM engine, front end, filter, and
 setup GUI.
 .
 SCIM achieves the communication between IM engines and front ends through
 both shared library linking and server/client mode.  It supports XIM
 protocol, as well as GTK+ IM module and Qt IM module.
 .
 This package is the main binary package of SCIM.  It includes: the main
 program scim (GTK+ based) and other support programs; simple configuration
 module, X11 front end module, rawcode IM engine module,
 simplified/traditional Chinese conversion filter module, and their
 corresponding setup GUI modules; GTK+ panel and its setup GUI module; and a
 GTK+ based setup tool.
 .
 SCIM is a well accepted platform and features various input method engines
 for many languages.  In Debian you can find the following separately packaged
 IMs useful: scim-tables-{additional,ja,ko,zh}, scim-pinyin, scim-uim,
 scim-m17n, scim-chewing, scim-anthy, scim-canna, scim-prime, and scim-skk.
 GTK+ users would also find package scim-gtk-immodule useful for GTK+ IM
 module support.
 .
 For development on SCIM platform, please see the description of scim-dev
 package.

Description: development library for SCIM platform
 SCIM (Smart Common Input Method) is an input method (IM) platform.
 .
 This package provides development libraries on SCIM platform, including the
 header files and static libraries.  The development documentations can be
 found in the scim-dev-doc package.
 .
 SCIM can be used as a dynamically loaded library on a single machine, or as a
 server/client model through socket in a network environment.  As a component
 of the system, SCIM can work with existing IM framework such as XIM or IIIMF
 (in progress), as well as using client specific IM interface, such as GTK+
 IM module or Qt IM module.  SCIM provides an IM application, scim, which use
 various IM engines to provide input methods for many languages, either by
 native modules (such as scim-pinyin and scim-hangul) or interfaces to other
 IM libraries (such as scim-anthy, scim-uim, scim-m17n, and scim-chewing).
 .
